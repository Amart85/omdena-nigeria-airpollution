# Omdena Port Harcourt Air Pollution

Leveraging Data Science Techniques to Raise Awareness of Air Pollution in Nigeria

## Contribution Guidelines
- Have a Look at the project structure and folder overview below to understand where to store/upload your contribution
- If you're creating a task, Go to the task folder and create a new folder with the below naming convention and add a README.md with task details and goals to help other contributors understand
    * Task Folder Naming Convention: task-n-taskname.(n is the task number) ex: task-1-data-analysis, task-2-model-deployment etc.
    * Create a README.md with a table containing information table about all contributions for the task.

- If you're contributing for a task, please make sure to store in relavant location and update the README.md information table with your contribution details.

- Make sure your File names(Jupyter notebooks, python files, datasheet file names, etc) have proper naming to help others in easily identifying them.
- Please restrict yourself from creating unnecessary folders other than in 'tasks' folder (as above mentioned naming convention) to avoid confusion.
